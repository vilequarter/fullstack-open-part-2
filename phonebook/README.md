This project practices using a locally-hosted JSON database to read and write
data. It connects to a database containing JSON data of entries. These entries
can be filtered by name. New entries are added via the form and then saved
to the database. Entries can also be deleted, and when a name is entered
that already exists, the app can also change the existing entry in the
database.
